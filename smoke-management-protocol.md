# Smoke Management Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol outlines the procedures and thresholds for minimizing smoke impacts on communities and sensitive populations during prescribed fire operations within the Truckee Ranger District.

## Weather Monitoring Thresholds
Prescribed burns will only be conducted when atmospheric conditions ensure adequate smoke dispersion. The following thresholds must be met:

- **Minimum mixing height**: 500 meters
- **Minimum transport wind speed**: 5 knots
- **Maximum surface wind speed**: 15 knots
- **Ventilation rate**: >5000 m²/s
- **Smoke dispersal index**: Good or Excellent (per NOAA guidance)
- **Relative humidity**: 30% - 60%
- **Temperature**: 40°F - 80°F

## Coordination with Air Quality Districts
1. **Pre-burn notification**: Submit a burn plan and smoke management plan to the Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District (NSAQMD) at least 7 days prior to ignition.
2. **Daily coordination**: On the day of the burn, contact the NSAQMD forecast office for an updated air quality and dispersion forecast.
3. **Real-time monitoring**: Utilize portable air quality sensors positioned downwind of the burn unit.
4. **Post-burn reporting**: Submit a smoke impact summary to the district within 24 hours after burn completion.

## Community Notification Procedures
1. **Advance public notice**: Issue a press release and social media posts at least 48 hours before planned ignition.
2. **Direct notification**: Contact local community associations, schools, and healthcare facilities within a 5-mile radius.
3. **Real-time updates**: During active burning, provide updates via the district's Twitter account and local radio.
4. **Smoke complaint hotline**: Operate a 24-hour hotline (555-123-4567) for residents to report smoke concerns.
5. **Sensitive population outreach**: Coordinate with local health departments to notify individuals with respiratory conditions.

## Contingency Plans
- **Smoke intrusion**: If smoke impacts a sensitive receptor, implement a temporary hold or reduce ignition intensity.
- **Unexpected weather changes**: If conditions fall outside thresholds, cease ignition immediately.
- **Public health advisory**: If air quality index (AQI) exceeds 100 (moderate), consider postponing the burn.

## Documentation and Record Keeping
- Maintain a log of all weather measurements, air quality data, and notifications.
- Archive all correspondence with air quality districts.
- Document any smoke complaints and actions taken.
