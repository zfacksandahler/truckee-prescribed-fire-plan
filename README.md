# Truckee Ranger District Prescribed Fire Operations Plan

This repository serves as the central hub for managing the Truckee Ranger District's Annual Prescribed Fire Operations Plan using GitHub's version control and collaboration tools.

## Purpose
To improve transparency, collaboration, and version control for prescribed fire planning within the Tahoe National Forest. This repository enables better tracking of changes, easier coordination with inter-agency partners (such as air pollution control districts), and maintains a clear record of plan revisions.

## District Commitments
- **Safety First**: Ensuring all prescribed fire operations prioritize firefighter and public safety.
- **Ecosystem Health**: Using fire as a tool to restore and maintain resilient, fire-adapted landscapes.
- **Smoke‑Sensitive Community Awareness**: Minimizing smoke impacts on communities, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions and allergies, through careful weather monitoring and proactive communication.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhering to all federal, state, and local air quality regulations and guidelines.

## Repository Structure
- `annual-plan-2024.md` – Main annual plan with objectives, burn units, key personnel, and timeline.
- `smoke-management-protocol.md` – Detailed protocol for minimizing smoke impacts, including weather thresholds, coordination procedures, and community notifications.
- `contact-list.md` – Key contacts for coordination during prescribed fire operations.

## Workflow
1. **Planning**: Documents are drafted and reviewed in the `main` branch.
2. **Updates**: Proposed changes are made via feature branches and submitted as Pull Requests.
3. **Review**: Pull Requests are reviewed by relevant personnel (Fuels Management Officer, Air Quality Coordinator, etc.).
4. **Integration**: Approved changes are merged into `main` after passing all checks.
5. **Documentation**: All changes are tracked through commit history and linked issues.

## How to Contribute
Inter-agency partners and district staff are encouraged to:
- Open Issues to suggest improvements or report needed updates.
- Submit Pull Requests for specific plan modifications.
- Use the discussion features (Issues, Pull Request comments) to collaborate on plan refinements.
